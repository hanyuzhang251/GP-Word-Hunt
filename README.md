# GP Word Hunt
 
## How do I run this
1. download the entire project
2. edit main.cpp and set the dir variable to the directory the project is in (path to the project folder)
3. there should be a cmake already in the project, run that somehow

## What does it do
After like everything loads, put in the word hunt chart left to right for each row and top to bottom. After a few seconds it should start outputting the answers in the order longest to shortest. After you put the word in on the wordhunt, type anything then press enter.
